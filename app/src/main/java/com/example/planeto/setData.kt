The drillmaster's cane loomed large.\"Vindhya Himachal …\"He grunted in discomfort. This was unbearable. He considered making a dash; after all he was in the last row. What if the master noticed? The cane loomed again. He gritted his teeth.\"Tava shubha …\"This is it.

A smile spread across her face as she spotted Maria, her daughter, in the middle of the garden enjoying the weather. It started drizzling. Maria started dancing joyfully.She tried to wave to her daughter, but her elbow was stuck, her arm hurt, her smile turned upside down. Reality came crashing down as the drizzle turned into a storm. Maria's murdered corpse consumed her mind.On a windy winter morning, a woman looked out of the window of her jail cell."

Reyaz, with the help of a friend, got a fake identity card--his new name was Rakesh--and booked a ticket to Aligarh. The ticket checker on the train asked for his identification--Reyaz nervously showed the one he had recently procured. He seemed satisfied and Reyaz heaved a sigh of relief.At Aligarh there was none to fear. \"Assalamu alaikum,\" said Reyaz to ward off a group of enraged people. The angriest of them, with bloodshot eyes, approached Reyaz and asked for his identity card."

Time to call airport security. The burly cop strode in purposefully, with a sleek Alsatian on leash. \"Sir, there's been a complaint. I need you to come with me. Quietly, please,\" he growled. The leather-jacketed man didn't move a muscle. His hands were rock-steady on the trolley handle in front of him. The cop waited for a minute, and then reached out to handcuff the Ray-Ban-wearing guy. The hands were locked in rigor mortis."

She needed no assurance, no promise. She squawked a reply when they asked if she was ready to go back to her room. It would be another 10 minutes before the duty nurse wheeled him away.She had laughed at the last tooth he had lost. He had teased her about the silver hair at the back of her sweater."

One of them handed her an envelope with a mournful expression, adding plaintively, \"We're sorry, Mrs Bhatt.\"\"Where's my dad, Uncle? He promised we'll celebrate Diwali together this time,\" exclaimed the girl. They stared helplessly, with a lump in their throats and moistened eyes."

I often visited their house, ate with them.One day, while I was slurping down the milk, a man entered their portico, begging for food.The father yelled at him and pushed him out of the entrance.I was terrified, and in a jiffy, I ran away screaming, \"Meow!
